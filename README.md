# INFO233_small_database_example
Small individual project from Advanced Programming, course code INFO233 from University of Bergen. Experimenting with JavaFX and SQLite.

NOTES
- MAY NOT RUN FROM REPO, SQLite library not included.
- Written with IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.
- CreateDB.java based on file DatabaseReseter.java posted by Theo Arril at coderanch <https://coderanch.com/t/306966/databases/Execute-sql-file-java>
- Follows DAO, DTO and MVC design patterns.
- Room for improvement, contains repeated code within DAO and DTO files. DTO files are named after the table they represent.
